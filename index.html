                <h2 class="s-h2">Sudan: Why has fighting broken out there?</h2>
                <p class="s-p">The fighting that has erupted in the Sudanese capital,
                Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country is a direct result
                of a vicious power struggle within the country's military
                leadership.
                The clashes are between the regular army and a
                paramilitary force called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).</p>
                <img src="IMG_0806.webp" alt="" srcset="" class="b2-img">
                <h3 class="s-h3">Who is fighting who in Sudan?</h3>
                <p class="s-p">Since the 2021 coup, Sudan has been run by a council of
                generals, led by the two military men at the centre of this
                dispute:
            </p>
            <p class="s-p">• Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the armed
            forces and in effect the country's president</p>
            </div>
            <p class="s-p">• And his deputy and leader of the RSF, Gen Mohamed
            Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti.</p>
            <p class="s-p">They have disagreed on the direction the country is going
            in and the proposed move towards civilian rule.
            The main sticking points are plans to include the 100,000-
            strong RSF into the army, and who would then lead the
            new force.</p>
            <h3 class="s-h3">Why did the fighting in Sudan
            start?</h3>
            <p class="s-p">The shooting began on 15 April following days of tension
            as members of the RSF were redeployed around the
            country in a move that the army saw as a threat.
            There had been some hope that talks could resolve the
            situation but these never happened.
            It is disputed who fired the first shot but the fighting swiftly
            escalated in different parts of the country with more than
            400 civilians dying, according to the World Health
            Organization.</p>
            <h3 class="s-h3">What do the two sides want?</h3>
            <p class="s-p">Gen Dagalo has said, in a series of tweets, that Gen
            Burhan's government were "radical Islamists" and that he
            and the RSF were "fighting for the people of Sudan to
            ensure the democratic progress for which they have so
            long yearned".</p>
            <p class="s-p">Many find this message hard to believe, given the brutal
            track record of the RSF.
            Gen Burhan has said he supports the idea of returning to
            civilian rule, but that he will only hand over power to an
            elected government. Some suspect him of having links to
            ex-President Bashir and his allies, which the army has
            denied.
            There are suspicions that both generals want to hang on
            to their positions of power, unwilling to losing the wealth
            and influence that go with them.</p>
            <h3 class="s-h3">What are other countries doing?</h3>
            <p class="s-p">There are fears that the fighting could further fragment the
            country, worsen political turbulence and draw in
            neighbouring states.
            Diplomats, who have played a crucial role in trying to urge
            a return to civilian rule, have been trying to find a way to
            get the two generals to talk.
            Soon after the fighting began a regional bloc agreed to
            send three presidents - from Kenya, South Sudan and
            Djibouti - to Khartoum, but the mission never happened.
            The UK, US and EU have all called for a ceasefire and
            talks to resolve the crisis and many countries are now
            focused on trying to get their citizens out.</p>
